just another repository

Dear souls,
im a 16 year old boy who has absolutly no idea about code.
i have a 2 main hobbies as of right now which are watching anime and going out with friends but, as of know (8/8/16 18:08) i plan to add coding to this short list of hobbies.
Well thats all from me, good bye for now souls.

So its day 1 and hopefully ill carry this on... I say hopfully because coding is actually a really hard habbit to get in to and consiquently I'm not good a difficult things... Well that was a slight lie, I do enjoy small challenges and higher maths...
